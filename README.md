## Description

The Drink to the Weather application has many features in order to simplify the drinking experience. It primarily features the CocktailDB API which contains information on hundreds of cocktails which is used in order to search and get information on drinks which are recommended to the user. On the initial page, the user is greeted with a search column which allows them to either input a city name or to select a mood they are feeling to which the webpage will recommend them a drink. If they are not completely satisfied with the first recommended drink, they also have the option to select from 4 other drinks from the "Other Recommendations sections below the main drink information area. Clicking the image of any of the drinks in this section will pull that drink up to the main information section and show the information of the selected drink to the user. The recommendation for drinks based on weather is based off of the temperature for the inputted city which is from a list of drinks that we consider appropriate for cold, average, and hot weather.

## Features 

### __1.Tests__
    This code tests 

### __2. HTML Self-generator__

We wanted to create a responsive tablet that gives you all the information you need for drinks as well as displaying some information on the weather if applicable. When the user inputs a city, the average weather temperature for the city will show up below the instructions section of the page.
 


### __4. Other__

 __For later builds__

_Add an api that shows you where you can buy ingredients for the items_

We understand many users may not have a full bar at their homes to make every drink, so we would like to help them seek out the ingredients to help them make the perfect cocktail.

_Include an Api that automatically uses your ip address to search your city_

Who has the time to search? With that busy go-go quarantine lifestyle, we no longer have the time or energy to actually type in the name of my city. We want our website to do the work for you. It might be best to have the user be able to correct any errors that the automatic system makes or add additional cities but where we can remove work and add fun, we should. 

_The ability to toggle what you want to see_

I have never cared too much about windspeed but I desperately want to know what places feel like- if only there was some way to replace the windspeed with temperature feel and then have the computer save my settings so I don't have to go back every time. I don't exactly know what this would look like but I think it would really improve the usability of this product. 


## Usage
### This is meant for either the seasoned cocktail drinker to get that bar experience at home or the newbie looking to expand their repertoire of mixed alcoholic beverages.
